					<h1>Blue lights for pedestrians means "go" on traffic lights in Japan, technically green.</h1>
					<p>Speaking of New York, White lights on the traffic lights shows that you can go across a cross walk in front. Red has ofcourse the opposite meaning. There is green and red lights in Japan however people call green lights usually blue. Why is it? The answer is not understand at a world wide range because of a peculiar culture coming from the old Japan. We has described the color from green to blue as blue. For instance, green apples have been called as "Ao(blue) - Ringo(apple)" in Japanese</p>

					<h1>How do you cook instant noodles with the liquid soup packed in.</h1>
					<p>I found out that there is the difference how to cook the japanese instant noodles with the liquid soup packed at out of Japan. The recommendation of the company is as follows. First, you open the package and put the ingreguent over the noodle with no liquid soup and put boiled water. Next stops, you close the top and put the liquid soup bag onto the cover where it gets warm. You wait for 3 minutes a nd put the warmed liquid soup into the cup of your noodle. Done.</p>

					<h1>No half n half for your coffee in Star Bucks Japan</h1>
					<p>Usually, Sugar or milk appears on a shelf in the shops of U.S. and there you will see the option of milk such as non-fat one, whole one, half half one. However, it in Japan serves only the first two. If you wanna pour the half n half milk into your coffee, you can mix milk and potion milk.</p>
