      <p class="project__blurb2">
         In 2015, I took a class for design at <a class="project__link" href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/" target="_blank">Parsons New School</a> and strolled around new york city with the teacher and classmates to find out a culture or sense of new yorker, also visited to the whitney museum to be taught what is a history/new of the new york art. We had some projects on the ny art through the class, the ones which was finished as a gig poster and typography.

      </p>
      <div class="project__blurb2">
           - Design the gig poster for a music event in nyc this summer, July 29<br>
          (The process is define problem > research > brainstorm > design > evaluate > improve)

          What is the gig poster: 
      </p>
      <div class="project__blurb2">
         - The gig poster is a tradition of art posters designed for indie bands that started in the 60â€™s and is still going strong. musicians from joanna newsom and arcade fire to bob dylan and the national are using limited edition posters to accompany shows, as an often strikingly original counterpoint to their music. Just as in the old days, the artists silk-screen print by hand in batches of a few hundred.

          How to solve it: 
      </p>
      <div class="project__blurb2">
         - I considered where the poster will be put on then. I brought an idea from the station walls on the iconic mta (subway) in nyc below, where it's extremely a shabby location everybody knows. In addition, I chose the smashing pumpkins as artist bcz of my favorites.  
      </div> 

      <br>
      
      <br>
      <p class="project__blurb2"> Here is a example of a mta station as old as the one was built for the first time. Too much shabby now.</p>
      <br>
      <img class="image_item" src="assets/shabby.jpg" ></img>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="project__blurb2"> My idea for the poster was also coming from a graffiti that would be expected to be there, along with the shabby wall in the station. The texts written to a paper and scanned was used.</p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="project__blurb2"> Some variations here to hand in and after getting an advice and adding the fix, the one in black was finally completed.</p>
